# BinaryTree


## Intro

A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node. The nodes that hold other sub-nodes are the parent nodes. A binary tree offers programmers the benefits of an ordered array and a linked list; searching in a binary tree is as fast as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operations are as efficient as in linked lists.
